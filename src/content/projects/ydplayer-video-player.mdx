## Problem

Integrating media playback in Android apps often requires significant boilerplate - handling formats, buffering, controls, and device compatibility. Developers needed a simpler abstraction over ExoPlayer.

## Approach

Built a library that wraps ExoPlayer with a clean API and customizable UI controls. Focused on minimal setup, broad format support, and optimized resource usage - including lower-end devices.

## Key Features

- Multiple media format support (video and audio)
- Customizable playback controls that adapt to any app design
- Seamless integration with minimal configuration
- Optimized resource usage for lower-end devices

## Result

Open-source library on GitHub that lets developers add high-quality media playback to their apps in minutes instead of hours.
