## Problem

Android developers often need to display code snippets in their apps - whether for educational tools, documentation readers, or developer utilities. Existing solutions were either too basic or required heavy WebView-based rendering.

## Approach

Built a native Android library in Kotlin that renders syntax-highlighted code directly in Android views. Supports multiple languages including Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, and C++. Designed for easy integration with customizable themes and styles.

## Key Features

- Syntax highlighting for numerous programming languages
- Customizable themes and styles
- Easy integration into any Android project
- Performance-optimized for smooth rendering with large code snippets

## Result

Open-source library available on GitHub, enabling developers to add readable, visually appealing code presentation to their Android apps with minimal setup.
