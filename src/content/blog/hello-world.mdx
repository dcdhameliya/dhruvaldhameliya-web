## Key Takeaways

- This blog will cover engineering, architecture, and lessons learned building software.
- Posts will be structured, practical, and focused on real outcomes.

## Why I'm Writing

Building software is full of decisions — architecture trade-offs, technology choices, and patterns that only make sense in hindsight. I want to share what I learn along the way.

Expect posts about:

- **System design** — how I think about scalability, reliability, and simplicity.
- **Mobile engineering** — patterns that work at scale with Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, and beyond.
- **Lessons learned** — the kind of knowledge you only get from shipping real products.

## What's Next

I'll be publishing regularly. If you want to follow along, bookmark this page or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dhruvaldhameliya).

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Thanks for reading.
